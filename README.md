# Memory-game
Card games that test memory.

This project is for Software Engineering at ETHz

## Set up
To set up, we recommend using Ubuntu 20.4, which could be settled up using a virtual machine.
Then you need to install clion and wxwidgets.
Execute the following commands in a console:
1. `sudo apt-get update`
2. `sudo apt-get install build-essential` followed by `sudo reboot`
3. if on virtual machine : install guest-additions (https://askubuntu.com/questions/22743/how-do-i-install-guest-additions-in-a-virtualbox-vm) and then `sudo reboot`
4. `sudo snap install clion --classic` this installs the latest stable CLion version
5. `sudo apt-get install libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-dev` this installs wxWidgets (GUI library used in this project)


Then you should be good to go: open this project in clion, build and run.
